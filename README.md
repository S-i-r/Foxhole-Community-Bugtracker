# Purpose
The Foxhole Community Bugtracker allows a cleaner, friendlier place to keep track of bugs and issues. The tracker will ultimately serve as an ingest point for issues reported directly by players or transferred from the [Foxhole Official Discord](http://discord.gg/foxhole)

## Contributing Issues
* Search for relevant existing issues prior to making a new one.
* If referring to a Discord message from the Foxhole Official Discord, please include relevant information, and link to the original message.
* Add information to existing issues, especially when you can replicate it
